                    <p class="large">Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a tactical multiplayer first-person shooter computer game developed by Valve Corporation and Hidden Path Entertainment, which has also continued to maintain Counter-Strike: Source after release. This is the fourth game in the popular Counter-Strike series. If not counting the two online versions Counter-Strike Online (2007)
                        and Counter-Strike Online 2 (2013).</p>
                    <p> The game is developed based on the original content from
                        Counter-Strike 1.6. Such as revamped versions of classic maps, weapons.
                        As well as adding new maps, characters and game modes. Multi-platform multiplayer game
                        was planned between Windows, OS X and PSN players, but was ultimately limited to
                        Windows and OS X because of the difference in the number of updates between the systems.</p>

                <p>If you've ever experienced the pain of finding a suitable teammate in CSGO, you probably understand how frustrating it can be. So I have made an option where CSGO players can find and contact teammates based on statistics of the player to find suitable teammates. And, more importantly,it's completely free !</b></p>
